## This repo contains a bash script named *“cars.sh”* that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
1. Entering a new car by prompting the user for:
* Year
* Make
* Model
2. Displaying the list of cars from the *"My_old_cars"* file
3. Quitting and exiting the program
